# HammerSpanish
A Valve Hammer editor modification to set the program language to Spanish (Castellano)
Currently only works for Portal 2 SDK, more games could be possible in a future.
Sadly, I couldn't translate the entire program, because some strings are inside the `.exe`, wich cannot be modified. But almost the entire thing is properly translated.




# How to install
In order to install this you only have to move the `hammer_dll.dll` to the `Portal 2/bin` folder. Make sure Hammer is closed while doing this.




# How to uninstall
To uninstall you can do the same process as the install part, but with the original `DLL` file provided, or remove the `DLL` and verify the SDK files.
